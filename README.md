__DESCRIPTION__

IRWebmachine is an interactive debugger you can use to trace and debug
requests made to a [webmachine-ruby](https://github.com/seancribbs/webmachine-ruby)
resource. IRwebmachine is designed to be used inside a REPL such as Pry, but 
there is very basic IRB support as well. I recommend Pry for now, as IRB support
is unfinished & Pry offers cool some features for free.

__USAGE__

The README is a very short overview, you can find examples & more on the 
[wiki](https://github.com/generalassembly/irwebmachine/wiki/Pry).

__PLATFORM SUPPORT__

  - CRuby 1.9+

__INSTALL__

    gem install irwebmachine
