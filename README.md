__DESCRIPTION__

IRWebmachine is an interactive debugger you can use to make, trace & debug
HTTP requests destined for a [webmachine-ruby](https://github.com/seancribbs/webmachine-ruby)
resource. IRwebmachine is designed to be used inside a REPL such as Pry, but 
there is very basic IRB support as well. I recommend Pry for now, as IRB support
is unfinished & Pry offers some cool features for free.

Examples & a walkthrough are available on the 
[wiki](https://github.com/generalassembly/irwebmachine/wiki/Pry).
