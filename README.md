__DESCRIPTION__

IRWebmachine is a collection of classes you can use to trace and debug your    
webmachine applications from a REPL like IRB or Pry. GET, POST, DELETE, &  
PUT requests can be made, the call stack of a request can be shown, and   
you can step inside any method on the call stack to inspect state at that   
point in the request. You can also step through a request as it happens,  
altering state to change the behavior of a resource. Usage examples for Pry,  
and IRB can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/generalassembly/irwebmachine/wiki/).
